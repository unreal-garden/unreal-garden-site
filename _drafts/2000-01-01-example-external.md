If you have an external post that you want to show up on the Unreal Garden list of articles, this is what you need to do:

1. Copy this .md file into _posts/tutorials.
2. Create a teaser image for your post. It should be 400x300px.
3. Work out what tags to mark your post with. See examples on the site for the list of existing tags. Please don't create new tags.
4. Change the metadata on the .md: title, excerpt, date, tags, author, teaser image, your url.
5. Test it works locally by using `bundle exec jekyll serve`. See README.md for more information.
6. Make a Pull Request with your change.
