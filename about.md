**Unreal{% include inline-logo.html %}Garden** is an **Unreal Engine** learning community with a focus on UI.

It grew out of [**ben{% include inline-logo.html %}ui**](https://benui.ca/).

It has some core principles:

1. **Be Kind**: Treat others with respect and dignity.
2. **Sow Seeds for the Future**: If you found something useful, write it down and share it with everyone coming after you. What you create now can grow into something bigger in the future.
3. **Human Solidarity**: Everything we make, we make to help ourselves and other _humans_.

## History

Unreal Garden was started in 2025. It was based on [**ben{%- include inline-logo.html -%}ui**](https://benui.ca/)'s set of tutorials and documentation for Unreal Engine and UI. He decided to step back from being the sole maintainer of his site and make it into something that many people could continue to maintain and contribute to.
