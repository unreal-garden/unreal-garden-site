## To do

- [ ] Move these TODOs into GitHub issues I guess?
- [ ] Need custom static teaser/preview screenshots for every page that includes the title text and logo.
  - [ ] Create script that makes static images of each page's header, saves them somewhere. Use the article slug as ID.
  - [ ] Change header matter to point to it, or include them automatically based on slug.
- [ ] Update bits.yml site preview script to output preview images as compressed .webp and not .png. Some files are large.
