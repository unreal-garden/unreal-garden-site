A round-table discussion on the different ways to store gameplay data in Unreal Engine. It was hosted on the benui Discord server on May 15th 2022. You should be able to see it embedded at the top of the page, or follow this [link to YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-N-j6W-DhE).
Thank you to everyone for participating and sharing your knowledge with the community!

Apologies for the technical difficulties at the start of the video. I managed to mute my audio so I couldn't hear anyone until around 11:05.

I'll be writing up a summary of the discussion in a future post, or modifying
my existing post on [Data-driven design]({% link
