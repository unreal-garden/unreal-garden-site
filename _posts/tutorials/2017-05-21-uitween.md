UMG has support for animation timelines through the editor, but I often find
them lacking. I created a [UI tweening library in
C++](https://github.com/benui-dev/ue4-uitween) to solve some of the problems
of UMG animations:

{:.procon}
- {:.pro}It's easy to create create multiple, offset animations for variable numbers of widgets inside containers. For example tweening each child of a VerticalBox with a delay between each element.
- {:.pro}It's possible to rearrange widget hierarchies without breaking animations.
- {:.pro}It's easy to scale animation durations, or have their speeds driven by code.
- {:.pro}Reusing animations between elements is easy.

```cpp
UUITween::Create(SomeWidget, 0.2f)
	.FromTranslation(FVector2D(-100, 0))
	.FromOpacity(0.2f)
	.ToTranslation(FVector2D(20, 10))
	.ToOpacity(1.0f)
	.Begin();
```

## Example Usage

{%
include figure-begin.html
title="Tweening elements within a vertical box with a delay between each element"
code="cpp"
%}
```cpp
const float DelayBetweenElements = 0.1f;
for (int32 i = 0; i < MyVerticalBox.GetChildrenCount(); ++i)
{
	UUITween::Create(MyVerticalBox.GetChildAt(i), 0.2f, DelayBetweenElements * i)
		.FromTranslation(FVector2D(-100, 0))
		.FromOpacity(0.2f)
		.ToReset()
		.Begin();
}
```
