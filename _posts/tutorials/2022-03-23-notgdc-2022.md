The Game Developer's conference rolled around again this year, and what with
the pandemic and fear of flying I didn't go. But I _did_ feel the pang of
missing out. In previous years people have posted talks and articles using the
hashtag [#notGDC](https://twitter.com/hashtag/notGDC) but for 2022 it was
looking pretty dead. So I figured let's revive it!

Despite no notice whatsoever, a bunch of wonderful people gave some fantastic
talks on various Unreal and UI-related topics. We hosted them as events on 
the [Unreal Garden Discord]({{ site.discord_url }}).


## Understanding Unreal's Input Stack

[Nicholas Helish](https://twitter.com/oldsiren) walked us through how player inputs
are handled in Unreal Engine. From the Unreal Heartbeat Tick down to Input
Components and gameplay.

## Creating a UMG/Slate Widget in Unreal Engine

I gave a sloppy rambling talk on how to copy-paste an existing UMG/Slate widget
and use it to create your own.

## Multiplayer Best Practices in Unreal Engine

[Omid Kiarostami](https://twitter.com/heyomidk)'s incredibly in-depth
talk on Multiplayer Best Practices was full of practical advice from his
years as a multiplayer programming expert. I learned so many things that I can
put to use!

## UMG Layout Techniques for Unreal Engine

[Scott Hernandez](https://twitter.com/superscott597) gave an amazing talk on
how to compose UIs in UMG. In particular how to create UIs that are reactive to
both the size of the content and the resolution of the display.

## Unreal Engine 5.0 Enhanced Input Walkthrough

[Alex Swaim](https://twitter.com/phoenixashes) covered Unreal Engine 5.0's new
Enhanced Input system in a wonderful talk that has given me kick in the pants
I needed to try the new system.

## Unreal Overloaded - Soft and Hard References - Primary Assets

[Amir Ansari](https://twitter.com/AmirAnsari09)'s talk covered a huge number
topics related to assets: the difference between hard and soft references, what
Primary Assets are and how to create custom editor tools.

## Designing Games for Commercial Success

[Victor D. Goossens](https://twitter.com/Mr4Goosey), co-owner of
[@VoxelPlugin](https://twitter.com/VoxelPlugin) gave a non-Unreal-specific talk
on game design for indies on how to create games that are more likely to
succeed, based on market analysis.

## Thanks Again

Thank you again to everyone who gave a talk and attended! We had so many
interesting questions from the audience, I think it's really helped everyone
feel more connected within the community.

I'm looking forward to #notGDC 2023!
