Infrequently Asked Question: What software and hardware do I use?

## Software

### Programming 

* [Rider for Unreal Engine](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/rider-unreal/). I used
  to use Visual Studio + Visual Assist X but Visual Studio was constantly hanging, and the
  P4VS plugin was terrible so I swapped to Rider. It's not perfect but it works
  better for me 99% of the time.
* [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/) for Unreal version control, and Git for personal stuff. Perforce is slow
  and clunky, but Unreal has so many binary files that you really need file
  locking and Git still doesn't really support that.
* [Python](https://www.python.org/) for workflow tools and scripts. Did you know that [Unreal has support for Python scripts](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/ProductionPipelines/ScriptingAndAutomation/Python/index.html) in the editor?
* [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) for Python, text files, markdown.
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking.

### UI

* [Affinity](https://affinity.serif.com/) for any image manipulation. It's not subscription-based (at least, not yet), and it's not too painful to swap from Photoshop.
* [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) still can't be beaten for designing, managing and outputting the huge batches of assets needed for buttons and all their states, text boxes, and everything else. I've tried Figma and it just felt a lot slower and less responsive than Sketch.
* Snip and Sketch program that comes with Windows. It's great for taking quick screenshots and scribbling on them.

## Web

* [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) with a bunch of plugins:
  * [Sidebery](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/sidebery/) for vertical tabs.
  * [uBlock Origin](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/) because the web is unusable without it.
* This page is created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), hosted in GitHub and was originally based on the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.
* Analytics are by [Plausible](https://plausible.io/benui.ca).
* I recommend [Duck Duck Go](https://duckduckgo.com/) for search.

## Hardware

* **Ergonomic keyboards** saved my hands. I was using an Apple keyboard at work and got terrible RSI, that went away after I swapped to an ergonomic keyboard. I've tried a few over the years and the Microsoft ones are usually pretty good.
* An **ergonomic mouse** is also vital. I use a cheap vertical mouse that you can get anywhere online. Takes a week to get used to but totally worth it.
* A computer with an SSD and the fastest CPU that you can afford. Graphics card is secondary, get a good CPU for shorter compile times.
