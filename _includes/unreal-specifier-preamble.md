This page attempts to be an exhaustive list of all the `{{ include.type }}` specifiers,
giving explanations, sample code, screenshots and related links for each.

# General Points

* Tags are **case insensitive**, but I would recommend sticking to the
  case example here for readability.
* Quotation marks are optional if the values does not have spaces. e.g.
  `someBool=true` is treated the same as `someBool="true"`. Again, for
  readability I would recommend using quotation marks only around string-type
  properties.
