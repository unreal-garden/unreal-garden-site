    comment: |
      Any Blueprint subclass of a class marked with `Const` has a few unique features:
      - The values of Blueprint subclasses can be changed in the BP, but not at run-time.
      - It has no event graphs, and cannot have event graphs added to it.
      - Any Blueprint-defined functions cannot set values on properties, even properties defined in the Blueprint subclass.
      - Local variables within functions _can_ have their values set.
      - Any Blueprint-defined functions are automatically marked as const. Although the const flag can be un-checked (this seems like a bug?).
      - It is possible to define and call Event Dispatchers (aka delegates) in the Blueprint subclass.
      - C++ Properties marked with `BlueprintReadWrite` will be converted to `BlueprintReadOnly` in the Blueprint.
      - Any BlueprintImplementableEvent functions must be `const` or there is a compilation error.
      - Any BlueprintNativeEvent functions must be `const` or there is a compilation error.

      This specifier is not frequently used in engine code.

      Say you have a class `UCameraComponent`, and within it you define a `BlueprintCallable` function `SetFieldOfView`. Next, imagine you are creating an orthographic camera class that is a subclass of `UCameraComponent`. `SetFieldOfView` no loner makes sense in this new child class, so to hide it you add `HideFunctions="SetFieldOfView"` to its `UCLASS()`.

      From what I can tell, this is effectively an alias for `IgnoreCategoryKeywordsInSubclasses=true`. A class with this specifier will cause the engine to add the `IgnoreCategoryKeywordsInSubclasses` metadata. This in turn causes all subclasses ignore `ShowCategories`, `HideCategories`, `AutoExpandCategories`, `AutoCollapseCategories` and `PrioritizeCategories`.
  
      Seems to be used on minimal-ish Actors that wrap components. For example on `ALight` that wraps `ULightComponent`, `ASkeletalMeshActor` that wraps `USkeletalMeshComponent`.

    comment:
      Only seems to be used in one place in the source, `UCommonTextBlock`. Seems to cause the specified categories to be shown first.

      Note that the category names are _space_ separated, not comma-separated.

    documentation:
      text: Causes only the class's type information to be exported for use by other modules. The class can be cast to, but the functions of the class cannot be called (with the exception of inline methods). This improves compile times by not exporting everything for classes that do not need all of their functions accessible in other modules.
      source: https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/class-specifiers
    comment: |
      I find it a bit tricky to understand MinimalAPI. If you have a class that exists in one module and you want to be able to cast to it in another module, I add MinimalAPI.

      In ascending order of "how much gets exported" I think of it like this:
      1. No class specifiers, no `API` macros: nothing exported, the class and its functions are only available within its own module.
      2. `UCLASS(MinimalAPI)`, no `API` macros: the class can be `Cast<T>` to outside of its module, nothing else.
      3. `MYMODULE_API` on certain functions: only those functions can be called outside of its module.
      4. `MYMODULE_API` on the class itself: all functions can be called outside of its module.

      In general it's good practice to only mark the bare minimum with MYMODULE_API.
    samples:
      - |
        // For example we have a class in MyGameplayModule that we want to be able to cast to elsewhere
        // Note we do *not* add MYGAMEPLAYMODULE_API
        UCLASS(MinimalAPI)
