  id: collision-data-in-ue5
  description: 'Collision data is largely defined by content creators, but its users
    are mostly systems written by programmers. Big games have more collision data,
    and more systems using it. Unreal Engine provides a great framework for collision,
    but problems can emerge at scale.

    In this talk, George Prosser will share some of the lessons learned developing
    ''Hogwarts Legacy'', and the strategies Studio Gobo have employed on their latest
    project. The talk will include best practices for managing collision settings,
    and tips for writing collision queries more effectively, giving an overview of
    much of Unreal Engine''s collision framework in the process.'

    ‚Äúcallstack.‚Äù Additionally, we'll examine case studies and discuss classification
    tools we use internally to automate crash grouping in Jira. This approach allows

  id: codeless-automated-tests
  description: 'The ever-increasing ambitions of the AAA videogame industry come with
    exploding design complexity, and keeping quality in check requires ever more ingenuity.
    That‚Äôs why Gearbox created Polaris, an Unreal Engine 5 plugin for automating tests,
    empowering the people who make the game with user-friendly QA tools so they can
    create tests that will live throughout the development process.

    Polaris enables QA professionals, designers, artists or developers to simulate
    in-game behavior via automated agents. By running these tests periodically in
    build pipelines, the team can keep tabs on advancement and regressions over the
    entire development process.

    Polaris is fully integrated within the Unreal Engine ecosystem and project-agnostic.
    It has a friendly Slate-based GUI and relies on the FTEST system. It integrates
    well with build systems, including console builds.

    These automated agents have already demonstrated that their potential extends
    beyond QA. We believe they also constitute a strong basis for future applications
    including in-game data generation, and reinforcement learning (RL)-based agents
    able to extend the coverage of tests. In fact, the tool is being developed with
    these future features in mind.'

- title: Idea for Making it Easy for Users to Give Bug Reports
  id: making-it-easy-for-users-to-give-bug-reports
  description: 'Make it easy for users to give accurate bug reports: 1. Add a "report
    bug" button in-game. 2. Game opens a Google form, pre-filled with tech info from
    your game: game version, user hardware specs, windows version. 3. Game also opens
    the users'' save and log folders to attach.

    To get the format for the pre-filled URL, use the ... from your google form. Replace
    the example values you give with the info from your game. You''ll also need to
    UrlEncode() the input text.

    In Unreal, open the page using LaunchURL. See next links for how to open folders.

    Some of this code can be found through my [Youtrack filler plugin](https://github.com/BraceYourselfGames/UE-BYGYouTrackFiller)

    What I like about this approach is it''s flexible. You can add a screenshot in
    the form showing users how to drag & drop their save file into the form. Or you
    can add individual fields for map seed, exact coordinates in the game world and
    not require a save.

    Also you don''t have to use Google forms, any web form that supports pre-filling
    from URL key/value pairs would work.'

    Apply Instance Changes to Blueprint

    I shouldn''t be fighting to add tooling to edit the BP class. Instead I should
    drag an instance into a level, edit that and apply back to BP. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è'

- title: FString Case Sensitivity
  id: fstring-case-sensitivity
  description: |
    You may have heard that `FString` is case-sensitive and `FName` is not, but that is not the whole story.
    `operator==` is *case-insensitive*, so the following code will return `true`:
    ```cpp
    FString("hello") == FString("HELLO") // I am true
    ```
    To add to the confusion, `FString::Equals` defaults to `ESearchCase::CaseSensitive`, so it is case-sensitive:
    ```cpp
    FString("hello").Equals(FString("HELLO")) // I am false
    ```

- title: FName Case Sensitivity
  id: fname-case-sensitivity
  description: |
    By default, `FName`s do not preserve case in built versions of your game. So the following is true:
    ```cpp
    FName("hello") == FName("HELLO") // true in editor, false in built game
    ```

    Changing this behaviour requires you to build your own version of the engine. To change the behaviour you can adding the following to your project's `Target.cs` file:
    ```cs
    PublicDefines.Add("WITH_CASE_PRESERVING_NAME=1");
    ```
